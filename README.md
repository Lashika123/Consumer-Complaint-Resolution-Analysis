# Consumer Complaint Resolution Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing consumer complaints using machine learning models to predict resolution outcomes. The dataset consists of various customer grievances filed with a company, and the goal is to classify whether a complaint will be resolved efficiently based on different factors such as the nature of the complaint, the companyâ€™s response, and customer demographics.

By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models, this analysis can help businesses improve their complaint resolution strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing complaint distribution, response times, and resolution rates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Label Encoding.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Comparing multiple classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- **Performance Metrics**: Using accuracy score and confusion matrices to assess model efficiency.

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Code Explanation
### 1. Import Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.ensemble import (
    RandomForestClassifier,
    AdaBoostClassifier,
    GradientBoostingClassifier,
)
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
```

### 2. Load and Explore Data
```python
train_data = pd.read_csv("Consumer_Complaints_train.csv")
print(train_data.head())
print(train_data.info())
```
This step loads the dataset and provides an initial overview of the columns, missing values, and data types.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Encode categorical features
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
train_data["Product"] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_data["Product"])
train_data["Company Response"] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_data["Company Response"])

# Handle missing values
train_data.fillna(train_data.mean(), inplace=True)
```
Categorical variables such as `Product` and `Company Response` are encoded into numerical values, and missing data is handled appropriately.

### 4. Train-Test Split and Feature Scaling
```python
X = train_data.drop(columns=["Complaint ID", "Resolution"])
y = train_data["Resolution"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and features are standardized for better model performance.

### 5. Train Classification Models
```python
models = {
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(),
    "Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    "XGBoost": XGBClassifier(),
    "Gradient Boosting": GradientBoostingClassifier(),
}
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(f"{name} Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
```
Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy scores.

### 6. Model Performance & Insights
- The best-performing model can be selected based on accuracy.
- Confusion matrices can be plotted to analyze misclassification rates.
- Hyperparameter tuning can further optimize model efficiency.

## How to Use
1. Run the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or Google Colab.
2. Modify the dataset path if needed.
3. Train different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
4. Use insights to enhance customer complaint resolution strategies.
